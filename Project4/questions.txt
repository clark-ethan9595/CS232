Question 1:
	Does your program run the same way each time? Why?

	- My program does not run the same way each time. This is because the scheduler, which schedules threads to run on the CPU, won't schedule threads in the same order
	each time. There are other processes running on this machine, so we do not know what the order of these threads are going to be. This affects the order in which the
	semaphores are grabbed and locked for each of the critical sections.

Question 2:
	Give your last customer thread the highest priority. Does this ensure that this customer is always given first priority? Why or why not?

	- Giving the last customer thread the highest priority does not ensure that it will always be given first priority. A higher priority thread may have to wait for a
	lower priority thread in the case that the lower priority thread is holding a semaphore that the higher priority is trying to get. The thread may run on the CPU more
	often, but as long as a different, lower priority thread is holding a semaphore that the higher priority thread is trying to access, that thread won't make any
	progress running on the CPU.
